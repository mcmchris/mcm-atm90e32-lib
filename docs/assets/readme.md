# MCM ATM90E32 Library for Arduino

The MCM_ATM90E32 Library simplifies the integration of the ATM90E32AS Energy Meter IC. It provides an easy-to-use interface and API to monitor 3-Phase or Split-Phase electrical systems with Arduino boards.

## Hardware Compatibility

This library is compatible with all Arduino boards that features an SPI interface. Although the MCM Split-Phase Energy Monitor is designed for the **Nano** form factor.
